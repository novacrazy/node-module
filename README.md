node-module
===========

### This project is defunct and outdated. I would not recommend using it, but feel free to browse the code and steal anything useful.

Type definitions and documentation for Node.js module internals, and how to exploit them.

<hr>

The src directory contains .ts files that you can copy into your own project to compile and use directory.

Otherwise, the .d.ts declaration files are in the top directory that can be referenced without any dependencies.
